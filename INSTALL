   Sys::Virt Installation
   ======================

Sys::Virt requires that libvirt already be installed on the
system. The libvirt libraries and header files are located using
the pkg-config database. If libvirt is installed to a prefix
other than /usr, then be sure to set the PKG_CONFIG_PATH environment
variable before building this module.

Regular installation:

  $ perl Makefile.PL
  $ make
  $ sudo make install


Install from non-standard location

  $ export PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/some/prefix/lib/pkgconfig
  $ perl Makefile.PL
  $ make
  $ sudo make install

-- End
